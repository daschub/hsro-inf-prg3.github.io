_Required class for [CS students](https://www.fh-rosenheim.de/technik/informatik-mathematik/informatik-bachelor/) at the [University of Applied Sciences Rosenheim](https://www.fh-rosenheim.de). --- Pflichtmodul im [Bachelorstudiengang Informatik](https://www.fh-rosenheim.de/technik/informatik-mathematik/informatik-bachelor/) an der [Hochschule Rosenheim](https://www.fh-rosenheim.de)._


# Class Schedule

**Lecture**: Wednesdays at 8a

**Tutorials**: Wednesdays at 9.45a/11.45a/1.45p; adjunct lecturer: Peter Kurfer

**Comunication** via [Mattermost](https://inf-mattermost.fh-rosenheim.de/inf-prg3/channels/town-square) ([invite](https://inf-mattermost.fh-rosenheim.de/signup_user_complete/?id=c8n9474tq3dm8mjn7cse1xsesa)).


# Class and Credits (_Leistungsnachweis_)
Lectures: Not your classic lecture--- we'll work together on concrete problems and their solution. The class will be taught in German, the materials are mostly in English.

Tutorials and assignments: Pairprogramming preferred, [_BYOD_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device) strongly recommended!

Credits: written exam (90') at the end of the semester.

# Syllabus
- **Introduction (Oct 4, [slides](01s-intro/), [lecture notes](01ln-intro/), [assignments](/01a-tools/))**
	
	With a few examples we dig right into the necessary tools of a (Java) software engineer: Git, IntelliJ, and of course: [Google](https://www.google.com), [SO](https://www.stackoverflow.com) and the [Java docs](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/).

- **Classes and Interfaces revisited (Oct 11)**
	
	We look at different types of classes revisited (inner, anonymous, local, static), when to use them, and which visibility for which purpose.
	Also: `@FunctionalInterface` and lambda expressions.

- **Inheritance revisited (Oct 18)**
	
	We talk about abstract and final classes, (pure) virtual functions and defaults.
	Also, when (and how) to use abstract base classes.

- **Generics, pt. 1 (Oct 25)**
	
	We dig into the details of how generics work in Java, and how to apply them to data structures and algorithms.

> No class and assignments on Nov 1 (All Saints/Allerheiligen).

- **Generics, pt. 2(Nov 8)**
	
	Generics and inheritance need special attention, and will lead us to bounds and wildcards.

- **Annotations and Reflection (Nov 15)**
	
	Learn how annotations and reflection work using examples of serialization (with [gson](https://github.com/google/gson)) and networking ([retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)).

- **Design patterns, pt. 1 (Nov 22)**

	We begin with a few basic patterns: composite, iterator and observer, and use that to dive into Android and MVC/MVVC.

- **Design patterns, pt. 2 (Nov 29)**

	We look at more every-day-patterns: singleton, factory, strategy and visitor.

- **Design patterns, pt. 3 (Dec 6)**
	
	We round up a few more useful patterns: proxy and adapter to make other peoples' modules fit your needs, and flyweight to save on precious memory in (mostly) graphical apps.

- **Parallel processing, pt. 1 (Dec 13)**

	Because sometimes, you need to work more than one thing at a time!
	We'll talk about threads and concurrency when it comes to resources.

- **Parallel proccessing, pt. 2 (Dec 20)**
	
	`Thread`s are clunky--- learn about a better `Future`, and what _promise chaining_ can do for you.

- **Introduction to functional programming (Jan 10)**
	
	Leave your imperative and objected oriented programming comfort zone and follow me down the rabbit hole of functional programming.

- **Functional programming in Java (Jan 17)**

	We talk about the specifics (and limits) of functional programming in Java.
	Learn about the basic `filter`-`map`-`reduce` and more sophisticated ones such as `collect` and `groupingBy`.

- **Review (Jan 24)**

	_TBA_.
